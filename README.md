# Spring Beans & Dependency injection demo project

## How to get it running
* Clone this GIT project
* Make sure it is a Maven project and Maven is executed to load dependencies
* Just start it to play around with it:
** ItemServiceConfig.java has to be changed for using Bean definitions in @Configuration style.
** BeanDemoApplication.java has to be changed for using XML Bean definition style.
